		<p>Starting in 2016 I discovered a large part of being involved in the party begins with
just showing up, and doing so has a tremendous impact on its processes. Since
then, I've applied myself to areas of interest where I feel I can make a difference.
One simply cannot overstate the importance of involvement, and if you’re
interested in changing our politics for the better and want to get involved, know
there are likely open positions for leadership, right now, wherever you live, and I
will gladly help you to find a position that interests you by sending an email at
michael@bearfootformn.com.</p>

		<p>I've been a voracious politics geek for years: I breathed politics, but being on the
margins and being unfamiliar with party politics I never pictured it as something
that was for me. After moving back to Minnesota in 2011 I became a delegate to the State
Convention, an experience that proved instructive for the presidential politics of
2016, where Senator Bernie Sanders’ campaign fired me up with a passion and
commitment for change. As a result I served as a national delegate for Sen. Sanders to the
Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. From these experiences, one of
the most influential and lasting ideas was realizing the importance of getting
involved within the party. The DFL, and Democrats generally, aren’t an “other”
making decisions; WE are the members, WE are the party, and taking seriously the
responsibility I feel to genuinely apply my commitment to improving the lives of
fellow citizens—people we know and people we do not know, alike—is through
impressing our values upon the Democratic Party as engaged leaders. In other
words, improving party politics means having a seat at the table as active,
thoughtful members. Running for DNC delegate is a one small, important way to
assure my communities have a direct voice in representation.</p>
