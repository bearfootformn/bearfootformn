		<p>A large part of being involved in the party is showing up. I really started to understand this in 2016. Since then, it's been a matter of finding areas of interest where I feel I can make a difference. There are always spots open. And I would like to take a moment to plug involvement. If anything I've said or you've seen in this process makes you interested in being involved or changing things for the better, there are open seats, right now, wherever you live. I can help you find those spots if you send me an email at michael@bearfootformn.com.</p>

		<p>I've been a voracious politics geek for years. I breathed politics, but being on the margins, I never pictured it as something that was for me. After moving back to Minnesota in 2011, I became a state delegate. This experience prepped me for 2016. The Bernie Sanders campaign fired me up in a new way, and I become a National Delegate to the convention in Philadelphia in 2016. One of the things I took away from one of his speeches during that time was the importance of getting involved in the party. One of the best ways to improve the lives of your fellow citizens is through the Democratic Party, and if you want to see it improve, you have to be at the table. Running now is a way for me to make sure my community has a voice and more people are represented.</p>
