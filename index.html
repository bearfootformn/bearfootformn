		<h5>Inclusivity</h5>
			<p>The Democratic party needs a heavy increase in inclusivity in everything it does.  I plan to approach every vote, every plan, every program from a place of intersectional inclusivity.  Being a black man with a disability, I've had my share of challenges, and I know for other, it can be much, much harder.</p>
		<h5>Integrity</h5>
			<p>One of the ways you can grow the already big tent, to be ever more inclusive is to have integrity.  I plan on increasing both our perceived and actual integrity.  I believe that the Democrat Party has more integrity than it is perceived to have, and I want to showcase that.</p>
		<h5>Transparency</h5>
			<p>To help in that pursuit of perceived integrity and the aforementioned inclusivity, The DNC desperately needs greater transperency.  There are so many conspiracies and rumors that wouldn't get wings if people just <b>knew</b> what was going on.</p>
