		<p>Hello, my name is Michael Bearfoot. I'm running to become one of Minnesota's representatives on the Democratic National Committee. As a black kid growing up poor—like living in your car poor, and even into my twenties—I always felt like politics happened to me. 2016 changed that, and I found out that we each can have a huge impact on our Democratic Party values.</p>

		<h5>Why I Am Running</h5>

		<p>The Democratic party must recognize the diversity of our neighbors and fellow citizens, and, increase its efforts for greater inclusivity. I’ve experienced my share of challenges, and I know for others, it can be even more difficult. This must change. We also need to increase the integrity of the party: our efforts within the party must match our rhetoric to the public, which at a minimum means applying our standards equally to everyone and being consistent in word and deed. Lastly, we must increase transparency: sunlight is the best disinfectant, and will positively impact the very real issues we face as a party.</p>

		<h5>What I Hope To Achieve</h5> 

		<p>How will I achieve and increase in the above mentioned areas of opportunity? First, I will approach every vote, every plan, and every program from a place of intersectional inclusivity, with such consideration increasing both our perceived and actual practices, and, demonstrating what we do well while acknowledging those areas where we can improve. I will also make sure that everything I touch is available to all, and that communications will be a two-way street: no viable reason can be made for removing party processes from the public view, let alone that of the DFL/Democratic membership. People make better decisions with better, fuller information about what’s happening, when it’s happening, and why.</p>

		<p>I want to hear from you! How can I best represent you? How can I earn your support?
