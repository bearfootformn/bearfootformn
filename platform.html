		<h5>Medicare for all</h5>
		<p>Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. Even when you have "good" insurance, like I do, you still have to fight. I fought for more than a year just to get a test. Never did get the test.  What do people go through when they don't have good insurance. No one should have to fight insurance when they or a loved one is fighting for their lives. And insurance should not be tied to employment.</p>
		<h5>Green New Deal</h5>
		<p>Without an environment to live in, there isn't anything else. There is so much to do and so little time to accomplish it. Now is the time for bold action. A green new deal not only assures that we tackle our planet's crisis, but provides good-paying union jobs all over the country. Especially in those areas hit by declining rates of industry, like the Iron Range of Minnesota.</p>
		<h5>Workers rights</h5>
		<p>There are many ways to address the enormous gulf of wealth disparity in this country; the first that would have a direct impact on many lives is to lift up the worker.  Here are but a few of the things that can help:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>$15/hr minimum wage</li>
			<li>Increased collective bargaining rights</li>
			<li>Paid sick and safe time</li>
			<li>Paid paternity leave</li>
			<li>Universal Basic Income</li>
			<li>A renewed investment in the trades</li>
			<li>Just to name a few...</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Save our democracy</h5>
		<p>Voting should be as easy and painless as possible.  End Citizens United.  Us Minnesotans are blessed with a very easy voting process; so many aren't.  And it still leaves some people out in the cold.  Voting should be a holiday with everyone getting the day off, or better yet, vote by mail.  Some states have been doing it for quite some time.  Redistricting needs to be done by an independent commission that is nonpartisan and follows established rules so we have concise representative districts.</p>
		<h5>Better relationship with Tribes</h5>
		<p>Uphold treaties and honor sovereign status of tribes. Invest in tribal infrastructure.  Address the opioid crisis by following the steps laid out by the NCAI Opioid Initiative.  The MMIW problem needs to be addressed, by doing things like passing the Savanna Act.  But in all of this, we need to ask for, accept, and respect their input.</p>
